									<h3 class="major">Overview</h3>
									<p>Starting in August 2022, I got involved with Dr. Kurth's research group, using data from the Juno spacecraft around Jupiter to study radio emmissions. For around half a year I was involved in a handful of different small projects, including identifying aurora crossings and various data visualization projects. </p>

									<p>Around the start of the winter semester, I moved to be more directly under Dr. Hospodarsky. There I started cataloging various 'whistler' emissions produced by lightning, that propagate through the plasma environment between Io and Jupiter. This cataloging was done completely manually, until Jeremy Faden and myself developed a tool for Autoplot that can catalog whistlers much easier. As of February 2024, ~120 whistlers have been recorded in both magnetic and electric field measurements. A github repository of my cataloging and other development can be found <a href="https://github.com/MilneBotMKII/Whistler-Research">here</a>. Currently, some preliminary results have been shared in posters and abstracts for AGU and ESA conferences. Eventually, this research will result in a couple publications, as well as an undergraduate thesis.</p>
